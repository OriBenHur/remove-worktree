# remove-worktree

A Git alias script that safely deletes both a worktree folder and its associated local branch in one command. This script provides a convenient way to clean up completed feature branches and their worktrees.

## Features

- 🗑️ **Complete cleanup**: Removes both the worktree directory and its associated local branch
- 🛡️ **Safety checks**: Prevents accidental deletion of protected branches (main, master, develop)
- 📋 **Smart detection**: Automatically detects the current worktree if no name is provided
- 🔍 **Worktree listing**: List all available worktrees with their branches and paths
- ⚠️ **Confirmation prompts**: Interactive confirmation to prevent accidental deletions
- 🎨 **Colored output**: Clear visual feedback with color-coded messages
- 🚫 **Force option**: Skip confirmations with `--force` flag
- 🔄 **Current worktree support**: Can delete the worktree you're currently in (with `--force`)
- 🧹 **Automatic cleanup**: Handles branch deletion even when checked out in current worktree
- 💡 **Helpful hints**: Provides guidance on using `--force` when appropriate

## Installation

### Option 1: Direct Installation

1. Download the script:
```bash
curl -o git-delete-worktree https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/remove-worktree/main/remove-worktree.sh
```

2. Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x git-delete-worktree
```

3. Move to a directory in your PATH:
```bash
sudo mv git-delete-worktree /usr/local/bin/
```

### Option 2: Git Alias Setup

1. Copy the script to your preferred location:
```bash
cp remove-worktree.sh ~/bin/git-delete-worktree
chmod +x ~/bin/git-delete-worktree
```

2. Add to your PATH (if not already added):
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
# or for zsh:
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

3. Create a Git alias:
```bash
git config --global alias.delete-worktree '!git-delete-worktree'
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Delete the current worktree and its branch
git delete-worktree

# Delete a specific worktree by name
git delete-worktree feature-branch

# Delete without confirmation prompts
git delete-worktree feature-branch --force

# List all available worktrees
git delete-worktree --list
```

### Command Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-h, --help` | Show help message |
| `-f, --force` | Force deletion without confirmation |
| `-l, --list` | List all available worktrees |

### Examples

```bash
# Delete current worktree (if you're inside it, you'll be prompted to switch first)
git delete-worktree

# Delete current worktree with force (bypasses current worktree protection)
git delete-worktree --force

# Delete a specific feature branch worktree
git delete-worktree my-feature-branch

# Delete a worktree without any prompts
git delete-worktree temp-branch -f

# See what worktrees are available
git delete-worktree -l
```

## How It Works

1. **Worktree Detection**: The script finds the worktree by name (folder name, not full path)
2. **Branch Association**: Automatically determines the local branch associated with the worktree
3. **Safety Checks**: 
   - Prevents deletion of protected branches (main, master, develop) without explicit confirmation
   - Validates that the worktree exists
4. **Smart Deletion Process**:
   - Attempts to delete the branch first (if possible)
   - Removes the worktree using `git worktree remove`
   - Handles current worktree deletion gracefully using main worktree as base
   - Automatically changes directory to avoid issues with deleted directories

## Safety Features

### Protected Branches
The script protects important branches by default:
- `main`
- `master` 
- `develop`
- `development`

To delete these branches, you must either:
- Use the `--force` flag, or
- Explicitly type "yes" when prompted

### Current Worktree Protection
If you're currently inside the worktree you want to delete, the script will:
1. Show you a list of other available worktrees
2. Prompt you to switch to a different worktree first
3. Provide a hint about using `--force` to delete from within the worktree
4. Exit safely without making any changes

**Note**: The `--force` flag bypasses this protection, allowing you to delete the current worktree safely.

### Confirmation Prompts
By default, the script asks for confirmation before deletion:
- Shows the worktree name, path, and associated branch
- Requires explicit confirmation (y/N)
- Can be bypassed with `--force` flag
- Provides helpful hints about using `--force` when cancelled

## Advanced Features

### Current Worktree Deletion
The script can safely delete the worktree you're currently in when using `--force`:
- Automatically detects when you're in the target worktree
- Uses the main worktree as the base for git operations
- Handles branch deletion gracefully (even if checked out)
- Automatically changes directory to avoid shell issues
- Provides clear feedback about the process

### Intelligent Branch Cleanup
- Attempts to delete the branch before removing the worktree
- Handles cases where the branch is currently checked out
- Provides informative messages about cleanup status
- Suppresses unnecessary error messages for better UX

## Output Examples

### Listing Worktrees
```bash
$ git delete-worktree --list
Available worktrees:
  NAME              BRANCH           PATH
  ----------------  ----------------  --------------------------------------------------
  main              main              /path/to/repo
  feature-login     feature/login     /path/to/repo/feature-login
  bugfix-123        bugfix/issue-123  /path/to/repo/bugfix-123
```

### Deleting a Worktree
```bash
$ git delete-worktree feature-login
Worktree name: feature-login
Worktree path: /path/to/repo/feature-login
Associated branch: feature/login

Are you sure you want to delete this worktree and branch? (y/N): y

Proceeding with deletion...
Deleting local branch: feature/login
✓ Local branch deleted successfully
Removing worktree at: /path/to/repo/feature-login
✓ Worktree removed successfully

✓ Successfully deleted worktree 'feature-login' and branch 'feature/login'
```

### Deleting Current Worktree with Force
```bash
$ git delete-worktree --force
Worktree name: feature-login
Worktree path: /path/to/repo/feature-login
Associated branch: feature/login

Proceeding with deletion...
Using main worktree directory for operations...
Deleting local branch: feature/login
⚠ Branch deletion failed (likely checked out), will be cleaned up after worktree removal
Removing worktree at: /path/to/repo/feature-login
✓ Worktree removed successfully

✓ Successfully deleted worktree 'feature-login' and branch 'feature-login'
```

## ⚠️ Note on Deleting Worktrees from Within Themselves

When you run this script from inside a worktree and that worktree is deleted, your shell is left in a deleted directory. This is a limitation of Unix/POSIX systems:

- Most commands (including git) will fail until you `cd` to a valid directory.
- The script will print a warning and suggest a `cd` command to recover.
- This is not a bug in the script, but a fundamental behavior of Unix shells and filesystems.

- [Stack Overflow: What happens if the current working directory is deleted?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/434417/what-happens-when-the-current-directory-is-deleted)

**Example error message:**
```
✗ Branch could not be deleted because the current working directory was deleted.
  This is a limitation of Unix/POSIX systems: when your shell is left in a deleted directory, most commands (including git) will fail until you cd to a valid directory.

## Requirements

- Git 2.5+ (for worktree support)
- Bash shell
- Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, WSL)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Not in a Git repository" | Make sure you're running the command from within a Git repository |
| "Worktree not found" | Check the worktree name (use `--list` to see available worktrees). Worktree names are folder names, not full paths |
| "Cannot delete bare repository worktree" | The script cannot delete bare repository worktrees. This is a Git limitation |
| Permission Denied | Make sure the script is executable: `chmod +x git-delete-worktree` |
| Branch deletion fails | This is normal when deleting the current worktree. The branch will be cleaned up automatically after the worktree is removed |
